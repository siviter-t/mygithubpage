title: "[Archive] My Old Flash Games: Displacer"

My love of coding started when I was relatively young. While my Father's influence was one of
my main motivators, back then I was somewhat captivated by video games. I had already
created the odd webpage prior to this point but it was those magical worlds that I immersed
myself in that inspired me &ndash; I just had to create my own.

In those days however, I didn't
end up producing anything of much worth; that took until the later years of secondary school
when I adopted Macromedia/Adobe Flash (the rich multimedia platform that once dominated the
internet) and its scripting language, ActionScript.
After following many tutorials and enduring countless hours of trial and error, I managed to
create several simplistic games that were, in
hindsight, quite terrible. Nevertheless I thought I'd showcase one of my most complete
examples, Displacer, for archival purposes.

I've since lost the sources and SWF files to the majority of these games but if I find them
I might update this post accordingly.

### Displacer

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/arc/flash/displacer.swf"
            width="800" height="580" id="Displacer"></object>
</div><br>

### Support

Of course, this game requires Adobe Flash Player to be installed on your system
(specifically versions 10 and up).
