> The _**Lampyridae**_ are a family of insects in the beetle order Coleoptera. They are winged
> beetles, and commonly called *fireflies* or *lightning bugs* for their conspicuous use of
> bioluminescence during twilight to attract mates or prey. Fireflies produce a "cold light",
> with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies.
